# Location tracking
Location tracking directly in the Oracle Database using Spatial features and Advanced Queuing.  
The scripts have been tested using a Free Tier Autonomous Transactional Processing (ATP) Database in both versions, 19c and 21c. It has also been tested using an Oracle Database Cloud Service 19c. 

For more information on Location Tracking support please check the Oracle Spatial DeveloperÂ´s Guide for either version [19c](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/spatl/location-tracking-server-concepts.html) or [21c](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/spatl/location-tracking-server-concepts.html).
